	  <p>I’m Jan Burkl, and I’ve spent my more than 15 years of programming experience not only in developing web-based software, but also in consulting accounts in different industry verticals setting up high-quailty software solutions.</p>
      <p>I’m a passionate believer in the technical process, and if you also think that Cloud, IoT and Big Data seen as one big picture makes real sense, we can talk about how to make life smarter.</p>
