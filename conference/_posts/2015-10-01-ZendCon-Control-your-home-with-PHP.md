# Control your home with PHP
I know it sounds crazy, automate your house using PHP, but it is possible, and it is fun. The problem is that there is no roadmap to follow, no path to show you how.    
In this talk I will show you how I automated my KNX-based heating, shutters, and lights using these simple tools.  
* REST API built with Apigility  
* AngularJS  
* Raspberry PI

Whether you want to turn on the Radio when you switch on the lights in the kitchen, or lower the shutters when you are watching TV, We will walk the path of home automation with PHP.
