# Build a Zend Framework 2 application in less than a talk
In this talk we present how to start and manage a new ZF2 application using composer and ZFTool. We will start a new ZF2 application from scratch adding a couple of existing modules, in order to create a simple Blog application with an authentication system. The talk will have a live session code, so switch on your laptop and be ready to code.
