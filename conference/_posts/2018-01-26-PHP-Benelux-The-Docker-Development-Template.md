# The Docker development template
Everybody is using Docker. Pull an image in minutes and start multiple containers in seconds. Great!

Unfortunately the public containers are normally not ready for an immediate use as a custom development system: Maybe the debugger is missing, the vhost is not configured correctly, or something app-specific has to be installed first.

In this session, I will show how to build your own custom system based on a Docker-compose template. This includes also the automatic setup of connections to other systems like DB servers or a load balancer to start a scalable cluster. And the best: The whole system configuration can be simply stored in a version control system, so that the Docker development template is available for all developers on the team.
