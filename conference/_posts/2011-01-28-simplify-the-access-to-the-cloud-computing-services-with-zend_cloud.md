# Simplify the access to the cloud computing services with Zend_Cloud
How to write a PHP application using cloud computing services? Basically you have to use the APIs published by vendors and build the software using these specific calls. If, for any reason, you want to change your cloud vendor, you must rewrite your PHP code using the API system of the new vendor. Rewriting a piece of software is always a cost, in terms of time and money. Using the Zend_Cloud class of the Zend Framework project you can write PHP applications that are portables across all major cloud vendors today. The Zend_Cloud is the evolution of the Simple Cloud API, a project of GoGrid, IBM, Microsoft, Nirvanix, and Zend Technologies to unify the access to the cloud services in PHP.
