# Modernize your app with Zend Expressive

In the last couple of years, I've seen many different applications: Spaghetti code, framework-based apps, and good or bad code quality.

But there's one thing most of them have in common at a certain point in time: For different reasons, it's hard to migrate to the state-of-the-art programming methodology. And now Zend Expressive comes into play. Zend Expressive is not only a slim middleware framework which implements the PSR-7 standard, but thanks to its simple base concept, Expressive is great as a quick start for your migration project and a smooth transition to the next generation of the app.

See in this session best practices on how to bridge your legacy system - like a ZF1 or Symfony 1 application - to Expressive and move it to the next level.
