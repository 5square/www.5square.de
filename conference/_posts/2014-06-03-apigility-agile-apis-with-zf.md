# Apigility: Agile APIs with ZF
Need an API? Don't have time to learn a framework, or learn all the ins and outs of the myriad emerging standards surrounding APIs? Just want to code?Apigility provides a streamlined interface for API-enabling your code -- whether you've written it yet, or are preparing to write it. I'll walk you through creating an API, creating and writing services, and even versioning your services so that they can grow with your organization's needs. I'll even demonstrate you how you can consume your API via a client-side application written in AngularJS, giving you a mobile interface to your API. So, come join me, relax, and learn how you can build and ship your new API!
