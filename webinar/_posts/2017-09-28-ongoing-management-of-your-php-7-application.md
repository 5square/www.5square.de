Jan Burkl, systems engineer and overall PHP wizard walked through what it takes to manage PHP applications. Taking the day-to-day viewpoint, Jan dissected each area into its many parts.

### When it comes to security, think big
Big picture that is. Jan advises to think in many directions – not just one specific area. PHP applications are more than just applications, they include the entire stack, from OS to database and servers. So, for security, he says, “Take a broader look at security, it’s not just one thing or another, It’s everything.” Start with the key pillars, application and stack. This encompasses the community, internal and customer-driven security policies, custom code, skillsets, QA tools, and ongoing support.
