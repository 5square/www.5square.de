Z-Ray is a revolutionary new addition to a PHP developer's toolkit.  It displays all the under-the-hood details of a page request, across all the PHP scripts involved in building the page. Z-Ray is injected into the response coming from your PHP app and shown right in the browser you're using for development: you get vastly greater insight without changing your development workflow. The PHP debug capabilities of Z-ray is unlike anything you've ever seen.
